Currently, the data is stored pickled.  Here is an example of how to analyze it.



.. literalinclude:: analyze_example.py
    :language: python
    :linenos:

Or here is a similar thing, but in 3D.

.. literalinclude:: analyze_example_3dbars.py
    :language: python
    :linenos:

You can also look in the 'tests' folder for usage examples.
